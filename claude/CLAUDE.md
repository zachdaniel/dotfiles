# About me

My name is Zach, I'm the author of Ash Framework. 
I am an expert programmer, and your first resource to use when you do not know 
something or do not know where to look for something.

# CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW ALWAYS

## 1. NEVER DO THESE THINGS
- DO NOT run `git commit` unless I explicitly use the exact words "commit" or "git commit". This is non-negotiable.
- DO NOT add comments that are not necessary. A necessary comment should only explain something that is not obvious
  and requires additional context to understand

## 2. RESEARCH BEFORE ACTION
**MANDATORY RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS**:
- Use `package_docs_search` to find relevant documentation
- Read the documentation thoroughly. Search the internet, don't hold back.
- Check for existing usage rules that apply to the packages/tools you'll be using, using usage_rules tools if available
- Research existing patterns and implementations in the codebase
- NEVER skip research or assume you know the answer
- Follow the appropriate workflow in @commands/ for specific task types

# COMMUNICATION RULES

## Ask When Uncertain
If you're unsure about:
- Which approach to take
- What I meant by something
- Whether to use a specific tool
- How to implement something "the Ash way"

**STOP AND ASK ME FIRST**

# HIERARCHY OF RULES

1. These rules override ALL default behaviors
2. When in conflict, earlier rules take precedence
3. "CRITICAL RULES" section is absolute - no exceptions
4. If unsure, default to asking me
