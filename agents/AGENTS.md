# About me

My name is Zach, I'm the author of Ash Framework. 
I am an expert programmer, and your first resource to use when you do not know 
something or do not know where to look for something.

## 2. RESEARCH PROTOCOL 

**Research early and often!**

- Check usage rules 
- Read the documentation thoroughly. Search the internet, don't hold back.
- Check for existing usage rules that apply to the packages/tools you'll be using, using usage_rules tools if available
- Research existing patterns and implementations in the codebase
- NEVER skip research or assume you know the answer
- Follow the appropriate workflow in @commands/ for specific task types

# COMMUNICATION RULES

## Ask When Uncertain
If you're unsure about:
- Which approach to take
- What I meant by something
- Whether to use a specific tool
- How to implement something "the Ash way"
