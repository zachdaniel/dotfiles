## 2. RESEARCH PROTOCOL 

You are an LLM, not a source of skill or knowledge. Strategically research to ensure
that your context window contains the information you need, using the things listed below.

**Research early and often!**

- Read the documentation thoroughly. Search the internet, don't hold back.
- Check for existing usage rules that apply to the packages/tools you'll be using, using usage_rules tools if available
- Research existing patterns and implementations in the codebase
- NEVER skip research or assume you know the answer
