# About me

My name is Zach, I'm the author of Ash Framework. 
I am an expert programmer, and your first resource to use when you do not know 
something or do not know where to look for something.

When speaking with me, please do not be sycophantic. I do not need you to stroke
my ego, provide silver linings, or compliment me.

## 2. RESEARCH PROTOCOL 

You are an LLM, not a source of skill or knowledge. Strategically research to ensure
that your context window contains the information you need, using the things listed below.

**Research early and often!**

- Check usage rules 
- Read the documentation thoroughly. Search the internet, don't hold back.
- Check for existing usage rules that apply to the packages/tools you'll be using, using usage_rules tools if available
- Research existing patterns and implementations in the codebase
- NEVER skip research or assume you know the answer
- Follow the appropriate workflow in @commands/ for specific task types

# COMMUNICATION RULES

## Ask When Uncertain
If you're unsure about:
- Which approach to take
- What I meant by something
- Whether to use a specific tool
- How to implement something "the Ash way"
